Classify Iris Flowers
Iris flower classification is a very popular machine learning project. The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’. The aim of the iris flower classification is to predict flowers based on their specific features.
Steps to Classify Iris Flower:  1. Load the data
2. Analyze and visualize the dataset
3. Model training.
4. Model Evaluation.
5. Testing the model.
Here we imported a support vector classifier from the scikit-learn support vector machine.
The accuracy is  96%.
